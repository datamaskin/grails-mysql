# Grails 2 With MySQL

## Background
Initially I was planning to use this repository to learn about Grails with MySQL. However do to my laziness I decided to gather everything that I learn about Grails into this repository.

## Links
- [Grails with MySQL][1]
- [Grails with Spring Security][2]

## Configurations

Currently there is no grails-app/conf/DataSource.groovy available. To create one just copy the content of grails-app/conf/DataSource-sample.groovy and configure the MySQL credentials.

## Running the application

Execute the command: grails run-app
